# Tovias-Enigma
This is a simple app build in React and NodeJS that takes an input string and an expiration date and encrypts it. It also offers a decrypter to retrieve the message. It was created by Teddy Hays to show his development skills for employment evaluation with Tovia.


DEPLOYMENT

To run, download the source zip and enter the directory in your terminal.

Run the following commands:
- npm install
- node server

The NodeJS server hosting the project should be up and running on "localhost:8080" for your enjoyment.

Thanks!
Teddy Hays
